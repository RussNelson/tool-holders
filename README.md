I'm trying to get my work area more organized. Stop leaving tools on my
workbench. To that end, I've been 3D printing tool holders that get mounted on
DIN "top hat" rail. DIN rail (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_rail) has been
around for 80 years, and is mostly used to mount circuit breakers and other
electronics. It's nice because it's relatively inexpensive, easy to mount, and
comes in some very long lengths.

I have been adding to the Thingiverse collection
(https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4888847/) as I go along, and intend to
continue. I have published the source (OpenSCAD) in Github
(https://github.com/RussNelson/tool-holders) so that people can contribute
their own designs. 

Imagine if this takes off, and we have a large community of users. Maybe tool
manufacturers will start paying attention, and will publish designs for their
own tools? It's just a file and a relatively small one, too. Then, everybody
who buys a tool will have a way to keep it out of their toolbox and off their
workbench.

To that end, please share this, and tag people and groups who would find this
useful. I think I'll call the idea "Tophat Tools". That can be a group name,
domain name, hashtag, or whatever.
